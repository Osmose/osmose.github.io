Summary: affiliates@lists.mozilla.org is up and moderated again and ready for use.

Now that we've released a [brand new Firefox Affiliates site][affiliates], we
could use some feedback and suggestions. We also want to be better at being open
about Affiliates development, and an easy and useful step is to actively use a
public mailing list for discussion among the team members.

Thus, I revived the [affiliates@lists.mozilla.org][mailing-list] as a place for
the team to discuss our work as well as a place for people to leave feedback,
ask questions, or get involved with making Affiliates a more effective service.

You should totally check the site out and send feedback to the mailing list.
Like right now.
