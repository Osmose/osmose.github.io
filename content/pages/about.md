Summary: A quick summary of Michael Kelly

I am a computer programmer!

More precisely, I am a web developer at [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/).
The projects I work on or have worked on in the past include:

- [django-browserid](https://github.com/mozilla/django-browserid)
- [Firefox Affiliates](https://affiliates.mozilla.org/)
- [about:home Snippets Service](https://snippets.mozilla.com/)
- [Firefox Flicks](https://firefoxflicks.mozilla.org/)
- [careers.mozilla.org](https://careers.mozilla.org/)
- [and tons more!](https://github.com/Osmose?tab=repositories)

I also like to help out with the [Webdev group](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Webdev)
within the project. They're cool people!

I live in Melbourne, Florida. Besides work and side projects, I play a lot of
video games and a few board games. It gets hot here.

Bye!
